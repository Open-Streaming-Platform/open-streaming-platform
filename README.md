## Overview:

**Open Streaming Platform (OSP) is an open-source, RTMP streamer software front-end for [Arut's NGINX RTMP Module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module).**

OSP was designed a self-hosted alternative to services like Twitch.tv, Ustream.tv, and Youtube Live.

## Features:
 - RTMP Streaming from an input source like Open Broadcast Software (OBS).
 - Multiple Channels per User, allowing a single user to broadcast multiple streams at the same time without needing multiple accounts.
 - Video Stream Recording and On-Demand Playback. [![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/nCawXQs.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/nCawXQs.jpg)
 - Per Channel Real-Time Chat for Video Streams. [![N|Solid](https://imgur.com/73Z3VB1.jpg)](https://imgur.com/73Z3VB1.jpg)
 - Manual Video Uploading of MP4s that are sourced outside of OSP
 - Real-Time Chat Moderation by Channel Owners (Banning/Unbanning)
 - Admin Controlled Adaptive Streaming
 - Protected Streams to allow access only to the audience you want.
 - Live Channels - Keep chatting and hang out when a stream isn't on
 - Webhooks - Connect OSP to other services via fully customizable HTTP requests which will pass information
 - Embed your stream or video directly into another web page easily
 - Share channels or videos via Facebook or Twitter quickly
 - Ability to Customize the UI as a Theme for your own personal look [![N|Solid](https://imgur.com/PldclhG.jpg)](https://imgur.com/PldclhG.jpg)
