## Overview:

**Open Streaming Platform (OSP) is an open-source, RTMP streamer software front-end for [Arut's NGINX RTMP Module](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module).**

OSP was designed a self-hosted alternative to services like Twitch.tv, Ustream.tv, and Youtube Live.

## Features:
 - RTMP Streaming from an input source like Open Broadcast Software (OBS).
 - Multiple Channels per User, allowing a single user to broadcast multiple streams at the same time without needing multiple accounts.
 - Video Stream Recording and On-Demand Playback. [![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/rEvqMPq.png)](https://i.imgur.com/rEvqMPq.png)
